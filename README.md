# Alexandr Lisseyenko 👋

I am a Software Engineer based in **Prague**, focused on backend architecture, system-level development, and automation.

### 👤 About Me
* **Background:** I combine deep academic informatics with intensive, project-based engineering drills.
* **Focus:** I enjoy the challenge of manual memory management in C just as much as architecting scalable cloud services in Python.
* **Mindset:** I advocate for clean code, automated workflows (Makefiles), and containerization (Docker).

### 💻 What I Do
* **Systems Programming:** Exploring Unix internals, process management, and multithreading.
* **Backend Development:** Designing robust APIs and managing complex data flows.
* **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Building consistent development environments and deployment pipelines.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Languages:** `C/C++`, `Python`, `SQL`
* **DevOps & Tools:** `Docker`, `Docker Compose`, `Makefile`, `Git`.
* **Environment:** `Unix/Linux`, `Shell Scripting`.

### 🚀 Key Projects

**[VaultGo](https://github.com/sseyen/vaultgo) — Cloud Storage Application**
* **Stack:** `Python`, `Django`, `PostgreSQL`, `Docker`, `JavaScript`, `HTML/CSS`.
Architected a full-stack cloud platform for file management. I implemented secure user authentication, backend file-handling logic, and persistent storage.

**[Minishell](https://github.com/sseyen/minishell) — Unix Command-Line Interpreter**
* **Stack:** `C`, `Unix System API`.
Developed a functional terminal from scratch. I implemented process lifecycle management (`fork`/`execve`), pipes, redirections, and asynchronous signal handling.

**[Philosophers](https://github.com/sseyen/philosophers) — Concurrency & Multithreading**
* **Stack:** `C`, `Pthreads`.
Solved the Dining Philosophers problem to master thread synchronization. I utilized mutexes to prevent data races and architected a deadlock-free execution model.

**[So_long](https://github.com/sseyen/so_long) — 2D Game Logic**
* **Stack:** `C`, `MiniLibX`.
Built a 2D game engine logic from the ground up. I focused on real-time event handling, map parsing, and sprite rendering.
